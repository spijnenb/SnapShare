# SnapShare

Something I've build to learn Node.js. With Snapshare you can upload and share images. Your fellow users can vote on these images and leave comments.

## Getting started

With these instructions you can easily install this app on a local machine.

### Prerequisites

This a Express app. You will need Node, NPM and MongoDB to run the app. I recommend using [Laragon](https://laragon.org) to quickly install everything you need.

### Installing

Check if node is installed.
```
node -v
```
Check if npm is installed.
```
npm -v
```
You can use the package.json to install all the dependencies. Run the following command.
```
npm install
```
Make sure MongoDb is installed and running. Snapshare will by default connect to localhost.
Run Snapshare with the commmand.
```
node app.js
```
